# HashtagSeeker

# About

This project is a instagram feed copy that consumes an api to show data according to a determined hashtag.

The api has a limitation on the number of requests, in this case, it is running every 30 minutes and not in real time.

The profile that posts the photo must be public to have the images reflected in the app.
